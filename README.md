#Bing Maps ISS Tracker
###### The classic learning-to-code practical excercise of developing an application that is able to track the current location of the International Space Station

This implementation is using the Bing Maps API to provide interaction and control functionality and the ISS data is provided by [open-notify](http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json) which is being pulled to update the position of the ISS every 10 seconds.
